Each row contains a latitude/longitude coordinate based on the parolee\u2019s address on file (redacted from this file), as well as additional information on original and derived county, city, and zip code and metadata that indicates who confident we are that the point corresponds to the address. Because the parole system doesn\u2019t include historical data, parolees who exited the system before 2009 won\u2019t be represented in this data set.\n\n\nFrom IDOC:\nplease note you are receiving parolee address information as of the last day of the FY for all active parolees for the added period in question. There are some cautions associated with address data including; some parolees are showing as AWOL which means the parolee is currently not residing at a known/approved location. In addition, some addresses are actually county jail addresses where parolees are being held pending new criminal charges. Some addresses are treatment facilities, recovery homes, or homeless shelters where offenders may be residing temporarily. Finally, some address are merely places where the parolee meets with the agent but does not actually reside. While it is our policy to verify addresses to the best of our ability, there are a number of offenders who do not wish us to know where they really reside and as such, utilize the address of a family member or friend who they know will provide assurance that the parolee resides there. Also please note, addresses are input by Agents so there are always possibilities that human errors are contained in the dataset. These are a few of the reasons why we do not create policy based on address, as a number of our parolees live a transient lifestyle and do not necessarily reside where they work or commit new crimes.\n\n\nPlease access the full dataset in course database table: ildoc.il_doc_parole\n",

The questionnaire comprises 22\u00a0qualitative questions on past and expected future lending policies by participating institutions to the private non-financial sector as well as on credit demand. It thus complements existing statistics on loans and bank lending rates with information on supply and demand conditions in the German credit market. Ad hoc questions may be added on specific topics of interest.",
