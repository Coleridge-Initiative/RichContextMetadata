For each of the authors among the USDA and Bundesbank publications, for
which we have matched datasets:

Author 1, article title, journal title, year, (whatever other identifying information we have in the metadata that matches the REPEC API fields), dataset name (with all the possible variants that you have identified)

Author 2 ditto
 
That set of fields then need to be matched to the same fields from the
REPEC API to the extent necessary to get the right REPEC handle.
 
Then we send him the REPEC handle with the dataset name (with all
possible variants)

Publications for Repec will go in here:
https://github.com/NYU-CI/RichContextMetadata/tree/master/repec

Running the string search pubs overnight as those take a long time
Will collate with the manually curated pubs once that code is done
