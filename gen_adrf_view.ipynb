The data are mainly cross-sectional but contain one historical component, an indicator of public assistance receipt for the preceding 24 months. The most recent version of the data is stored in the main tables and each table has an accompanying change history. Because the spell files contain the time-varying history of benefits receipt for individuals and cases, only the most recent version of these tables is presented. \\xa0As such, this data is presented as time-invariant, with one record of each characteristic for a given individual or case, even though some characteristics (like case addresses) obviously do vary over time.\\n\\n\\nYou will find the complete data in the class database under the tables: idhs.assistance_case, idhs.case_geocode, idhs.case_social, idhs.member, idhs.member_info, idhs.member_relation\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
