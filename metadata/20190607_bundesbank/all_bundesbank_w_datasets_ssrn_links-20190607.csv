(2) The authors thank Claudia  Buch and  Heinz  Herrmann  and  participants  of  the  9th  Bundesbank  MiDi  Works Project
Workshop ""Europe’s Global Linkages and the Impact of the Financial Crisis:
(3) We use comprehensive information on the cross-border service trade of German ﬁrms for 2002-2008 from the German International Trade in Services Statistics (ITS ) and complement it with information on multinational service traders from the Micro Database Direct Investment (MiDi ) – both datasets are provided by the Deutsche  Bundesbank.
(4) The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 contains the description of the merged ITS-MiDi data along with the explanatory variables.
(5) This section describes the data that we use for our empirical analysis. We combine  two micro datasets provided by the Deutsche Bundesbank – the ITS and the MiDi – and complement them with information on cross-country and cross-sectoral occupational wages data as well as on credit constraints.
(6) ﬁrm. While the information on the single service transaction is very detailed, the dataset does not provide any ﬁrm-level characteristics. Thanks to a common ﬁrm identiﬁer, some
ﬁrm-level information can, however, be retrieved from the MiDi.
(7) The MiDi covers all international capital links from and to Germany (see Hügelschäf- fer et al., 2009) and is available for research purposes as a panel dataset, currently cov-
ering the time period 1996-2009.
(8) Before matching the ITS and MiDi, we made a few adjustments. First, we aggregated the individual service transactions in the ITS to the level of each firm, source country,
service type and year.
(9) Second, we grouped the single service categories in the ITS into eight larger categories and assigned each industrial sector in which a foreign aﬃliate is active
according to the MiDi to a corresponding service group (see Table A.1).
(10) The additional variables we use for the mode choice estimations are both constructed from the MiDi.


SITS
(1) Making use of new micro-level data on service imports of German multinationals from 2002-2008, 
(2) Using the micro-level German International Trade in Services (ITS) data, we calculate a 10% drop in service imports.
(3) Furthermore, they contain estimates (e.g. for transactions below the reporting limit of e12,500) and collective reports which are excluded from the ITS data.
(4) The ITS comprises information on all service transactions between German residents and non-residents that surpass the threshold of e12,500. Since the reporting limit is rather low, the ITS covers almost the entire population of German cross-border service transactions.
(5) In its original version, the ITS also includes reports from public authorities and private transfers, which we remove in order to focus on firms’ transactions.
(6) The ITS reports comprehensive service trade information at the level of the individual transaction (for both imports and exports):
(7) the individual service transactions in the ITS to the level of each firm, source country, service type and year.

database Dafne (the German equivalent of Amadeus) with data provided by  the Deutsche Bundesbank in its database on foreign direct investment (MiDi), which allows us to draw on information on the extensive and intensive margins of FDI and exports. The data are described in Part Three.
(3) Furthermore we adjust this information using data from  MiDi.
(4) By  combining  the  Dafne  database  with  the Deutsche Bundesbank’s Micro-Database Foreign Direct Investment (MiDi), we obtain information on foreign affiliates’ sales.

The hospitality of the Bundesbank and access to its  firm-level  Micro database Direct Investment (MiDi) are gratefully acknowledged.
(2) This study aims at explaining the regional dispersion of foreign multina- tionals’ affiliates by exploiting the firm-level Micro database Direct Invest- ment (MiDi) of the Deutsche Bundesbank. The MiDi is a full sample survey
of foreign firms’ affiliates in Germany.
(3) In fact, the heterogeneous nature of holdings would require more detailed information about actual occupations and tasks for which data is not available in the MiDi.
(4) The firm-level database MiDi contains information about the federal state, in which an MNE’s affiliate is located, about its sector and the source country of the investment.
(5) Section 4.1 provides a short description of the MiDi and how the dependent variable has been extracted from the database.
(6) The data on inward FDI come from the firm-level MiDi provided by the Deutsche Bundesbank (for details on this database see Lipponer (2008). The MiDi is a full sample survey of foreign firms’ affiliates in Germany. 
(7) In addition to the chosen federal state, information on the sector groups of the affiliates can be retrieved from the MiDi
(8) For this reason, the original worldwide country sample reported in the MiDi reduces here to 79 countries that have established an affiliate in Germany within the considered time frame 1997-2005. In princi- ple, the MiDi is a panel dataset since 1996

(3) We extract affliate-level information on employment and ownership (from MIDI) and parent-level information on fixed assets and value added (from USTAN).
(4) Third, we use the commercial database markus (from Verband der Vereine Creditreform) on German corporate ownership to combine the preceding two data
sources. MARKUS allows us to identify all onshore a±liates of MIDI-USTAN firms, to which we then link ba plants.
