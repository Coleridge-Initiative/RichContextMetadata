From IDOC:
please note you are receiving parolee address information as of the last day of the FY for all active parolees for the added period in question. There are some cautions associated with address data including; some parolees are showing as AWOL which means the parolee is currently not residing at a known/approved location. In addition, some addresses are actually county jail addresses where parolees are being held pending new criminal charges. Some addresses are treatment facilities, recovery homes, or homeless shelters where offenders may be residing temporarily. Finally, some address are merely places where the parolee meets with the agent but does not actually reside. While it is our policy to verify addresses to the best of our ability, there are a number of offenders who do not wish us to know where they really reside and as such, utilize the address of a family member or friend who they know will provide assurance that the parolee resides there. Also please note, addresses are input by Agents so there are always possibilities that human errors are contained in the dataset. These are a few of the reasons why we do not create policy based on address, as a number of our parolees live a transient lifestyle and do not necessarily reside where they work or commit new crimes.

","The point-in-time files are extracts from Chapin Hall’s Illinois Public Assistance Research Database (ILPARD). This database is compiled from sequential monthly point-in-time extracts from DHS. They cover participation in a number of public assistance programs including Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) and specific TANF initiatives (e.g., Work Pays), Medicaid, KidCare, Food Stamps, Transitional Assistance, Aid to the Aged, Blind, and Disabled (AABD), and Family Assistance. The data are mainly cross-sectional but contain one historical component, an indicator of public assistance receipt for the preceding 24 months. The most recent version of the data is stored in the main tables and each table has an accompanying change history. Because the spell files contain the time-varying history of benefits receipt for individuals and cases, only the most recent version of these tables is presented.  As such, this data is presented as time-invariant, with one record of each characteristic for a given individual or case, even though some characteristics (like case addresses) obviously do vary over time.

Spell files are available for three types of benefits:

- TANF - coded “tanf46” in data files and database.
- SNAP - coded “foodstamp” in data files and database.
- general cash assistance – coded “grant” in data files and the database.  Grant spells include TANF and all other state cash assistance programs, such as disability and refugee assistance.


Spell data is available broken out by:

- case (ch_dpa_caseid) where there is a row for each unbroken spell of benefits received by at least one person with a  given case ID.
- individual (recipient number) where there is a row for each unbroken spell of benefits received by a given member, across any number of cases.
- individual/case (indcase) where there is a row for each unbroken spell of benefits received by a given individual on a given case.  These spells are similar to those in the individual file, but what is one spell in the individual file might be multiple spells in indcase if the individual moved across cases.
