<b>Abstract:</b> Diary surveys are used to collect data on a variety of topics, including health, time use,<p>
nutrition and expenditures. The U.S. National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey<p>
(FoodAPS) is a nationally representative diary survey, providing an important data source for<p>
decision makers to design policies and programs for promoting healthy lifestyles. Unfortunately,<p>
a multi-day diary survey like the FoodAPS can be subject to various survey errors, especially<p>
item nonresponse error occurring at the day level. The FoodAPS public-use data set provides<p>
survey weights that adjust only for unit nonresponse. Due to the lack of day-level weights (which<p>
could possibly adjust for the item nonresponse that arises from refusals on particular days), the<p>
adjustments for unit nonresponse are unlikely to correct any bias in estimates arising from<p>
households that initially agree to participate in FoodAPS, but then fail to report on particular<p>
days. This paper develops a general methodology for estimating the extent of underreporting due<p>
to this type of item nonresponse errors in diary surveys, using FoodAPS as a case study. We<p>
describe a methodology combining bootstrap replicate sampling for complex samples and<p>
imputation based on a Heckman selection model to predict food expenditures for person-days<p>
with missing expenditures. We estimated the item nonresponse error by comparing weighted<p>
estimates according to 1) only reported expenditures and 2) both reported expenditures and<p>
predictions for missing values. Results indicate that ignoring the missing data would lead to<p>
consistent over-estimation of the mean expenditures and events per person per day and underestimation<p>
of the total expenditures and events. Our study suggests that the household-level<p>
weights which generally account for unit nonresponse may not be entirely sufficient for<p>
addressing the nonresponse occurring at the day level in diary surveys, and proper imputation<p>
methods will be important for estimating the size of the underreporting.<p>
