Abstract: Diary surveys are used to collect data on a variety of topics, including health, time use,
nutrition and expenditures. The U.S. National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey
(FoodAPS) is a nationally representative diary survey, providing an important data source for
decision makers to design policies and programs for promoting healthy lifestyles. Unfortunately,
a multi-day diary survey like the FoodAPS can be subject to various survey errors, especially
item nonresponse error occurring at the day level. The FoodAPS public-use data set provides
survey weights that adjust only for unit nonresponse. Due to the lack of day-level weights (which
could possibly adjust for the item nonresponse that arises from refusals on particular days), the
adjustments for unit nonresponse are unlikely to correct any bias in estimates arising from
households that initially agree to participate in FoodAPS, but then fail to report on particular
days. This paper develops a general methodology for estimating the extent of underreporting due
to this type of item nonresponse errors in diary surveys, using FoodAPS as a case study. We
describe a methodology combining bootstrap replicate sampling for complex samples and
imputation based on a Heckman selection model to predict food expenditures for person-days
with missing expenditures. We estimated the item nonresponse error by comparing weighted
estimates according to 1) only reported expenditures and 2) both reported expenditures and
predictions for missing values. Results indicate that ignoring the missing data would lead to
consistent over-estimation of the mean expenditures and events per person per day and underestimation
of the total expenditures and events. Our study suggests that the household-level
weights which generally account for unit nonresponse may not be entirely sufficient for
addressing the nonresponse occurring at the day level in diary surveys, and proper imputation
methods will be important for estimating the size of the underreporting.
