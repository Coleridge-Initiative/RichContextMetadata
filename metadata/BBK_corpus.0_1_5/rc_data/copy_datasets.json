In order to generate this structure several data manipulation operations were done on the raw QCEW data. Most notably, the QCEW is originally structured at the FIPS/NAICS/Ownership level, with “Ownership” referring to the governmental ownership status of the associated establishments(e.g. private, federal government, local government, etc). In order to reduce the dataset to the FIPS/NAICS level, the raw location quotients were combined using weighted averages based on establishment count. In addition, county/NAICS combinations that did not pass BLS’ disclosure standards are not included and state level statistics for each industry are not included.",

Since population size affects the error associated with population projections, these geographic units needed to have a minimum population, which were determined to be 15,000. This criterion resulted in combinations of neighborhoods that probably would not occur if one were solely designating boundaries of historical neighborhoods. Moreover, the neighborhood names associated with the neighborhood tabulation areas are not intended to be definitive. Another feature of the sustainability plan, was the creation of projections for Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs), which are approximations of New York City's Community Districts developed for use with the Census Bureau's Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS). In order to make the boundaries consistent with PUMAs, NTAs were created using whole census tracts, from the 2010 census, within PUMAs. Since NTAs were not permitted to cross PUMA boundaries, this further restricted our ability to identify what may be thought of as historical neighborhood boundaries. Thus, users need to be cognizant of the reason why NTAs were created and the demographic/geographic constraints inherent in how they were configured. Despite these limitations, NTAs are a valuable summary level for use with both the 2010 Census and the American Community Survey (ACS). Regarding the decennial census, these geographic areas offer a good compromise between the very detailed data for census tracts (2,168) and the broad strokes provided by community districts (59). For the ACS, NTAs offer a statistically reliable alternative to the high sampling error that renders data for most individual census tracts unusable. Note: park-cemetery-etc NTAs, while not contiguous, only represent five unique NTAs; one in each borough. However, each of these five NTAs may appear more than once in this table, as they may fall in more than one PUMA.",

Its primary objective is to support research questions falling within three broad and inter-related areas of income, labour market and family dynamics. The HILDA Survey is a household-based panel study of Australian households and, as such, it interviews all household members (15 years and over) of the selected households and then re-interviews the same people in subsequent years. This dataset is the 18th release of the HILDA data, incorporating data collected from 2001 through 2018 (Waves 1-18).

In addition, permanent monitoring of quality during the missions (Calval) and studies of the necessary corrections of altimetry data regularly add to our understanding and knowledge (see the Processing and corrections applied to each mission to obtain the reference mean sea level).",

This set of standard depth level (sdl) profiles is available for some of the gridded fields.
