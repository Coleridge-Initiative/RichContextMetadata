      "description": "To improve access to capital, the City of Chicago seeded a $2MM revolving loan fund and partnered with Accion to create the Chicago Microlending Institute (CMI). CMI helped train two new local microlenders, Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives (CNI) and Women's Business Development Corporation (WBDC), to help connect small businesses around the city to affordable access to capital. These microloans vary in size from $500 to $25,000 and the average loan size is around $10,000. This dataset reflects the lender, location, business industry, and borrower demographics for small businesses supported by the City's revolving loan fund. Certain data elements could not be included on a per-loan basis for privacy reasons but are summarized in the https://data.cityofchicago.org/id/4s8s-adbr dataset.",

      "description": "Location information for persons active in the Illinois parole system from 2009 to 2015. A given person could have multiple rows in this table, one per year they were on parole. Each row contains a latitude/longitude coordinate based on the parolee’s address on file (redacted from this file), as well as additional information on original and derived county, city, and zip code and metadata that indicates who confident we are that the point corresponds to the address. Because the parole system doesn’t include historical data, parolees who exited the system before 2009 won’t be represented in this data set.\n\n\nFrom IDOC:\nplease note you are receiving parolee address information as of the last day of the FY for all active parolees for the added period in question. There are some cautions associated with address data including; some parolees are showing as AWOL which means the parolee is currently not residing at a known/approved location. In addition, some addresses are actually county jail addresses where parolees are being held pending new criminal charges. Some addresses are treatment facilities, recovery homes, or homeless shelters where offenders may be residing temporarily. Finally, some address are merely places where the parolee meets with the agent but does not actually reside. While it is our policy to verify addresses to the best of our ability, there are a number of offenders who do not wish us to know where they really reside and as such, utilize the address of a family member or friend who they know will provide assurance that the parolee resides there. Also please note, addresses are input by Agents so there are always possibilities that human errors are contained in the dataset. These are a few of the reasons why we do not create policy based on address, as a number of our parolees live a transient lifestyle and do not necessarily reside where they work or commit new crimes.\n\n\nPlease access the full dataset in course database table: ildoc.il_doc_parole\n",

From this file, data users may determine which ZCTAs exist within the other geographies and vice versa. \r\n\r\nThe ZCTA relationship files are nation-based comma-delimited ASCII files and include all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nThese files represent intersections of geography only.  For instance, for the ZCTA to place relationship file, a unique combination of ZCTA and place FIPS code must exist for a record to be included in the file. Areas where the Census Bureau has delineated a ZCTA, but no place exists, are considered remainder records and are not included in this file. Situations where no ZCTA exists or where there is neither a ZCTA nor a place are also excluded from this file. The same logic applies to all other relationship files. However, data users should be aware that the totals given for the ZCTA or the geographic entity are full totals as published for the 2010 Census, therefore, data users should note that summing the part record totals may not match the totals for the ZCTAs and/or the related entities.",

The U.S. Census Bureau is releasing the initial version of public data from the reengineered SIPP.  This dataset contains variables from Wave 1 of the 2014 SIPP panel.  The SIPP is the Census Bureau’s premier survey for measuring the dynamics of income, employment, health insurance, and participation in government transfer programs.  The survey provides detailed, monthly information about the family, social, and economic contexts of individuals and households.  SIPP is a longitudinal survey, following the same set of respondents over a four-year period, allowing researchers to understand how these contexts change over time.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease see the 2014 Panel Users’ Guide, included with this dataset, for more details.",

The data are mainly cross-sectional but contain one historical component, an indicator of public assistance receipt for the preceding 24 months. The most recent version of the data is stored in the main tables and each table has an accompanying change history. Because the spell files contain the time-varying history of benefits receipt for individuals and cases, only the most recent version of these tables is presented.  As such, this data is presented as time-invariant, with one record of each characteristic for a given individual or case, even though some characteristics (like case addresses) obviously do vary over time.\n\n\nYou will find the complete data in the class database under the tables: idhs.assistance_case, idhs.case_geocode, idhs.case_social, idhs.member, idhs.member_info, idhs.member_relation\n\n\n\n",

This information is derived from case and member status tables.

Grant spells include TANF and all other state cash assistance programs, such as disability and refugee assistance.\n\n\nSpell data is available broken out by:\n\n- case (ch_dpa_caseid) where there is a row for each unbroken spell of benefits received by at least one person with a  given case ID.\n- individual (recipient number) where there is a row for each unbroken spell of benefits received by a given member, across any number of cases.\n- individual/case (indcase) where there is a row for each unbroken spell of benefits received by a given individual on a given case.  These spells are similar to those in the individual file, but what is one spell in the individual file might be multiple spells in indcase if the individual moved across cases.\n\n\nNote that prior work with the IL DHS data has identified both duplication and occasional reuse in the recipient number field.\n\n\nYou will find the complete data in the class database under the tables: idhs.case_spells, idhs.ind_spells, idhs.indcase_spells",

      "description": "Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs) were created to project populations at a small area level, from 2000 to 2030 for PlaNYC, the long-term sustainability plan for New York City. Since population size affects the error associated with population projections, these geographic units needed to have a minimum population, which were determined to be 15,000. This criterion resulted in combinations of neighborhoods that probably would not occur if one were solely designating boundaries of historical neighborhoods. Moreover, the neighborhood names associated with the neighborhood tabulation areas are not intended to be definitive.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother feature of the sustainability plan, was the creation of projections for Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs), which are approximations of New York City's Community Districts developed for use with the Census Bureau's Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS). In order to make the boundaries consistent with PUMAs, NTAs were created using whole census tracts, from the 2010 census, within PUMAs. Since NTAs were not permitted to cross PUMA boundaries, this further restricted our ability to identify what may be thought of as historical neighborhood boundaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, users need to be cognizant of the reason why NTAs were created and the demographic/geographic constraints inherent in how they were configured. Despite these limitations, NTAs are a valuable summary level for use with both the 2010 Census and the American Community Survey (ACS). Regarding the decennial census, these geographic areas offer a good compromise between the very detailed data for census tracts (2,168) and the broad strokes provided by community districts (59). For the ACS, NTAs offer a statistically reliable alternative to the high sampling error that renders data for most individual census tracts unusable.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: \"park-cemetery-etc\" NTAs, while not contiguous, only represent five unique NTAs; one in each borough. However, each of these five NTAs may appear more than once in this table, as they may fall in more than one PUMA.",

Projections are used for assessing short-range trends in occupational employment and resulting occupational opportunities. The projections process consists of four principal phases:\r\n\r\n\r\n1) Developing industry employment totals for the base year and industry employment estimates for the projected year. Projected year estimates are a function of national, state and local area variables including industry employment, industry indicators and labor force data.\r\n\r\n\r\n2) Collecting and analyzing Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) program survey data from 52,000 New York employers on how many individuals they employ in each occupation. The results generate an occupational distribution or staffing pattern for each industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n3) Applying occupational staffing patterns from the OES survey to the industry employment totals to produce base year occupational employment estimates. In turn, expected staffing pattern changes are applied to the base year pattern.  The modified staffing patterns are then applied to projected industry employment levels to obtain projected occupational employment levels.\r\n    \r\n\r\n4) Applying replacement rates to the projected occupational employment levels and adding growth to obtain estimates of occupational openings for approximately 800 specific occupations.",

      "description": "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a statistical measure of change, over time, of the prices of goods and services in major expenditure groups--such as food, housing, apparel, transportation, and medical care--typically purchased by urban consumers. Essentially, it compares the cost of a sample \"market basket\" of goods and services in a specific month relative to the cost of the same \"market basket\" in an earlier reference period. This reference period is designated as the base period.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CPI publishes indexes for two populations; all urban consumers (CU) and urban wage earners and clerical workers (CW). This dataset is for all urban consumers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo construct the two indexes, thousands of prices for commodities and services purchased by consumers are collected in a sample of 75 urban places. Rent data is collected in a separate sample of thousands of rental units. Comparison of indexes for individual CMSA's or cities show only the relative change over time in prices between locations. These indexes cannot be used to measure interarea differences in price levels or living costs.",

In order to generate this structure several data manipulation operations were done on the raw QCEW data. Most notably, the QCEW is originally structured at the FIPS/NAICS/Ownership level, with “Ownership” referring to the governmental ownership status of the associated establishments(e.g. private, federal government, local government, etc). In order to reduce the dataset to the FIPS/NAICS level, the raw location quotients were combined using weighted averages based on establishment count. In addition, county/NAICS combinations that did not pass BLS’ disclosure standards are not included and state level statistics for each industry are not included.",
