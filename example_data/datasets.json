      "description": "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a statistical measure of change, over time, of the prices of goods and services in major expenditure groups--such as food, housing, apparel, transportation, and medical care--typically purchased by urban consumers. Essentially, it compares the cost of a sample \"market basket\" of goods and services in a specific month relative to the cost of the same \"market basket\" in an earlier reference period. This reference period is designated as the base period.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CPI publishes indexes for two populations; all urban consumers (CU) and urban wage earners and clerical workers (CW). This dataset is for all urban consumers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo construct the two indexes, thousands of prices for commodities and services purchased by consumers are collected in a sample of 75 urban places. Rent data is collected in a separate sample of thousands of rental units. Comparison of indexes for individual CMSA's or cities show only the relative change over time in prices between locations. These indexes cannot be used to measure interarea differences in price levels or living costs.",

      "description": "Short-term industry and occupational estimates and projections are presented for New York State and its ten labor market regions. Projections are used for assessing short-range trends in occupational employment and resulting occupational opportunities. The projections process consists of four principal phases:\r\n\r\n\r\n1) Developing industry employment totals for the base year and industry employment estimates for the projected year. Projected year estimates are a function of national, state and local area variables including industry employment, industry indicators and labor force data.\r\n\r\n\r\n2) Collecting and analyzing Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) program survey data from 52,000 New York employers on how many individuals they employ in each occupation. The results generate an occupational distribution or staffing pattern for each industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n3) Applying occupational staffing patterns from the OES survey to the industry employment totals to produce base year occupational employment estimates. In turn, expected staffing pattern changes are applied to the base year pattern.  The modified staffing patterns are then applied to projected industry employment levels to obtain projected occupational employment levels.\r\n    \r\n\r\n4) Applying replacement rates to the projected occupational employment levels and adding growth to obtain estimates of occupational openings for approximately 800 specific occupations.",

CMI helped train two new local microlenders, Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives (CNI) and Women's Business Development Corporation (WBDC), to help connect small businesses around the city to affordable access to capital. These microloans vary in size from $500 to $25,000 and the average loan size is around $10,000. This dataset reflects the lender, location, business industry, and borrower demographics for small businesses supported by the City's revolving loan fund.

      "description": "Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs) were created to project populations at a small area level, from 2000 to 2030 for PlaNYC, the long-term sustainability plan for New York City. Since population size affects the error associated with population projections, these geographic units needed to have a minimum population, which were determined to be 15,000. This criterion resulted in combinations of neighborhoods that probably would not occur if one were solely designating boundaries of historical neighborhoods. Moreover, the neighborhood names associated with the neighborhood tabulation areas are not intended to be definitive.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother feature of the sustainability plan, was the creation of projections for Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs), which are approximations of New York City's Community Districts developed for use with the Census Bureau's Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS). In order to make the boundaries consistent with PUMAs, NTAs were created using whole census tracts, from the 2010 census, within PUMAs. Since NTAs were not permitted to cross PUMA boundaries, this further restricted our ability to identify what may be thought of as historical neighborhood boundaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, users need to be cognizant of the reason why NTAs were created and the demographic/geographic constraints inherent in how they were configured. Despite these limitations, NTAs are a valuable summary level for use with both the 2010 Census and the American Community Survey (ACS). Regarding the decennial census, these geographic areas offer a good compromise between the very detailed data for census tracts (2,168) and the broad strokes provided by community districts (59). For the ACS, NTAs offer a statistically reliable alternative to the high sampling error that renders data for most individual census tracts unusable.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: \"park-cemetery-etc\" NTAs, while not contiguous, only represent five unique NTAs; one in each borough. However, each of these five NTAs may appear more than once in this table, as they may fall in more than one PUMA.",

From this file, data users may determine which ZCTAs exist within the other geographies and vice versa. \r\n\r\nThe ZCTA relationship files are nation-based comma-delimited ASCII files and include all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nThese files represent intersections of geography only.  For instance, for the ZCTA to place relationship file, a unique combination of ZCTA and place FIPS code must exist for a record to be included in the file. Areas where the Census Bureau has delineated a ZCTA, but no place exists, are considered remainder records and are not included in this file. Situations where no ZCTA exists or where there is neither a ZCTA nor a place are also excluded from this file. The same logic applies to all other relationship files. However, data users should be aware that the totals given for the ZCTA or the geographic entity are full totals as published for the 2010 Census, therefore, data users should note that summing the part record totals may not match the totals for the ZCTAs and/or the related entities.",

The U.S. Census Bureau is releasing the initial version of public data from the reengineered SIPP.  This dataset contains variables from Wave 1 of the 2014 SIPP panel.  The SIPP is the Census Bureau\u2019s premier survey for measuring the dynamics of income, employment, health insurance, and participation in government transfer programs.  The survey provides detailed, monthly information about the family, social, and economic contexts of individuals and households.  SIPP is a longitudinal survey, following the same set of respondents over a four-year period, allowing researchers to understand how these contexts change over time.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease see the 2014 Panel Users\u2019 Guide, included with this dataset, for more details.",
