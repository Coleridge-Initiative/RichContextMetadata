      "description": "The MiDi is a collection of individual (i.e. firm-to-firm or private individuals-to-firms) investment relations originally collected to calculate aggregate measures of German foreign direct investment (FDI). It is based on an annual data collection on foreign direct investment stocks that was established by the Deutsche Bundesbank in 1976 in accordance with the German Foreign Trade and Payments Regulation (\\\"Aussenwirtschaftsverordnung\\\"), with the intention to get a better and more accurate picture of the structure and scope of inward and outward FDI of German enterprises. Since 1996, individual companies can be traced over time, which made it possible to prepare a micro-level panel dataset for research purposes. Due to changes in data protection regulation, the available anonymized research data covers all years from 1999 until the respective last currently processed year.",

The reporting requirement applies to German firms including banks, as well as to individuals and public authorities. The research dataset provides detailed information for service transactions of firms engaged in cross-border service trade, such as the transaction value for services exports and imports, the type of exported and imported services (eg transport, R&D etc), partner country and sector classification of the resident firm. The research data are available from 2001 as a panel dataset at a monthly frequency.",

      "description": "The goals of the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) project were to describe and identify predictors of mortality, hospitalization, and placement in long-term care facilities and to investigate risk factors for chronic diseases and loss of functioning. The survey elicited information from persons 65 years of age and older in four geographic locations: East Boston, Massachusetts, New Haven, Connecticut, Iowa and Washington Counties, Iowa, and five counties in north central North Carolina. The public use baseline data (Part 1) cover demographic characteristics (age, sex, race, income, education, marital status, number of children, employment, and religion), height, weight, social and physical functioning, chronic conditions, related health problems, health habits, self-reported use of dental, hospital, and nursing home services, and depression. Data from six follow-up surveys conducted in all four of the sites are also provided (Parts 2-4 and 6-8), along with information from death certificates for deaths occurring in the first six years of follow-up for all four sites (Part 5).",
