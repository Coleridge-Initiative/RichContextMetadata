Such dietary choices \\ncan lead to weight gain, as well as the development \\nof type 2 diabetes.9 The prevalence of obesity and \\ndiabetes is substantially higher among Hispanics \\nthan other groups.3,9 Despite generalities in dietary \\nchanges with acculturation among Latinos, there \\nremains a substantial amount of heterogeneity or \\ninconsistencies in findings across geography and \\ncultural group.10,11 Most published research on ac-\\nculturation and health among Latinos has focused \\non predominately Mexican-heritage populations in \\nCalifornia.10 Another research gap has been a lack \\nof consistency in measuring acculturation, making \\ncomparability across studies difficult.10 In new ar-\\neas of immigration, where accessibility of desired \\nfoods may be low and social networks limited, the \\nacculturation process may be markedly different in \\ncontrast to a “newcomer” in an established ethnic \\nneighborhood.10,12\\n\\nLatinos who are more acculturated to the US \\nlifestyle may increase alcohol consumption and \\nsmoking. However, a positive trend for engaging in \\nmore leisure-time physical activities also has been \\nobserved.13 Health insurance coverage and health-\\nseeking behavior may increase with a greater accul-\\nturation level.2,14 Nevertheless, use of social services \\nmay be more linked to immigrant or citizenship \\nstatus and income than acculturation.15 Healthcare \\nand social service professionals need knowledge of \\nLatino food behaviors, food resource management, \\nhealth-risk factors, and their relationships to ac-\\nculturation levels in varying contexts.16 Some food \\nsafety behaviors improve with acculturation, such \\nas prompt refrigeration of leftovers and not thaw-\\n\\ning meat at room temperature.17 \\nThere is a need for disaggregated data to address \\n\\nhealth disparities and to identify variations in expe-\\nriences and circumstances.18 Measuring accultura-\\ntion provides a finer level of detail than classifying \\ngroups by the Hispanic ethnicity identifier or coun-\\ntry of origin.19 This information is important for \\nimproving nutrition education and assistance pro-\\ngrams that serve those with limited incomes and \\nfor reducing health disparities among Latinos and \\nother ethnic groups.7,9,15,16,20\\n\\nHispanic women comprise the majority of the \\nservice population for the Expanded Food and Nu-\\ntrition Education Program (EFNEP) and Special \\nSupplemental Nutrition Program for Women, In-\\nfants, and Children (WIC) in Maricopa County, \\nArizona.21,22 Early lifestyle interventions in women \\nof reproductive age may reduce their chronic dis-\\nease rates in later years, thereby benefiting their \\nhealth as well as reducing healthcare costs.23 Edu-\\ncation and assistance programs such as EFNEP and \\nWIC can improve the health of participants by tai-\\nloring messages based on assessment and research \\nof current practices and perceived needs for Latinas \\nand all women. Program participation can affect \\nindividual lifestyle decisions as well as the future of \\ntheir families when the content is meaningful and \\napplicable.24,25 Few context-specific studies have \\nbeen published on the relationship between accul-\\nturation and health behaviors for Latinas or other \\nwomen with limited incomes in the southwestern \\nUS outside of California.10,26,27 \\n\\nIn April 2010, Arizona’s Senate Bill 1070 became \\nlaw singling out undocumented immigrants from \\npublic healthcare programs, schools, and work.28 \\nFor those undocumented immigrants living and \\nworking in the US, increased policing, surveil-\\nlance, prosecutions, and penalties restricted their \\nmovement.28,29 The escalation in surveillance led to \\nunintended consequences such as problems with \\nhousing and employment, psychological distress, \\nvulnerability, increased discrimination, and social \\nisolation.29 Data collection took place during the \\nchanging immigration policy period in Arizona \\nwith a vulnerable population of low-income wom-\\nen. Findings from the larger study on knowledge \\nof the health benefits of beans, and utilization of \\nnutrition assistance programs have been reported \\nelsewhere.15,26 The objectives of the current research \\n\\nhttp://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.5993/AJHB.42.3.6\\nhttp://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.5993/AJHB.42.3.6\\n\\n\\nC\\nop\\n\\nyr\\nig\\n\\nht\\n (\\n\\nc)\\n P\\n\\nN\\nG\\n\\n P\\nub\\n\\nlic\\nat\\n\\nio\\nns\\n\\n.

We chose the third session be-\\ncause it occurred before most survey educational \\nmaterial had been covered and fell in between the \\nArizona program’s pre- and post-evaluations. At \\nWIC and the unemployment center, we recruited \\nparticipants over 5 non-consecutive days as they \\nwaited for their appointments with program per-\\nsonnel. At these sites, 2-3 research team members \\ncirculated flyers and explained the study to women. \\nThe researchers emphasized that the study was vol-\\nuntary and was not part of the agency they were \\nvisiting. We read an informed consent document \\nto participants prior to survey completion. We pro-\\nvided $3 in food coupons (EFNEP) or cash (WIC, \\nunemployment center) as incentives. \\n\\nSurvey Instruments \\nThe survey included questions on demographics \\n\\n(eg, ethnicity, race, household composition, and \\nincome), food expenditure cost, use of nutritional \\nsupplements, and a 10-item Food Behavior Check-\\nlist questionnaire (FBC).31 Three of the FBC ques-\\ntions focus on food resource behaviors, 2 on food \\nsafety, and 5 on nutrition practices.31,32 The FBC \\nunderwent extensive validity and reliability review \\nby an expert panel, focus groups, and pilot testing \\nduring its original development.24\\n\\nThe Bidimensional Acculturation Scale (BAS), \\nused to classify acculturation status, provides mul-\\ntiple dimensions of cultural description by assess-\\ning both English and Spanish language preferences, \\nuse of media, and social engagement. Acculturation \\nclassifications of Hispanic-dominant (less accultur-\\nated), bicultural, or English-dominant (more ac-\\nculturated) were computed in accordance with the \\nBAS terminology and instructions for the Latina \\nwomen.19 Response scores are calculated between 0 \\nand 5 for the Hispanic and English dominant do-\\nmains. Domain values greater than 2.5 are used to \\nclassify into one category or the other, or bicultural \\nif both scores are over the cut-off. The original BAS \\nexhibits high internal consistency.19\\n\\nQuestions from the Behavioral Risk Factor Sur-\\nveillance System (BRFSS) on self-reported health \\nstatus, physical activity, cigarette smoking, health \\ninsurance, and doctor visits were included.33 These \\nquestions have exhibited high reliability in other \\nresearch.34-36 We asked participants to report their \\nheight and weight in either the English or metric \\nsystem. We used the EFNEP (including the FBC), \\nBAS, and BRFSS instruments verbatim from their \\npublished English and Spanish versions.19,32,33 \\n\\nStatistical Analysis\\nWe used IBM’s SPSS Statistics for Windows, \\n\\nVersion 24.0 (Armonk, NY) for data entry and \\nanalysis. We examined descriptive statistics were \\nby comparing across the 3 BAS acculturation cat-\\negories (Hispanic-dominant, bicultural, English-\\ndominant) and non-Hispanic white women. We \\nexplored relationships among demographics, food \\nbehaviors, health risk factors, self-reported height \\nand weight, and acculturation/ethnicity status us-\\ning chi-square analysis and ANOVA. We calculated \\nBMI using self-reported height and weight, with \\nthe resulting values categorized into underweight, \\nnormal, overweight, and obese.37 \\n\\nNine of the 10 items on the FBC were entered \\ninto a principal components analysis to determine \\nif the pattern of responses clustered on a single di-\\nmension. Because not all women had children in \\ntheir household, the question on “feeding children \\nafter waking” was excluded. Four statements were \\nreverse coded before analysis so that a higher vari-\\nable value reflected the desired behavior (run out \\nof food, add salt, thaw at room temperature, leave \\n\\n\\n\\nC\\nop\\n\\nyr\\nig\\n\\nht\\n (\\n\\nc)\\n P\\n\\nN\\nG\\n\\n P\\nub\\n\\nlic\\nat\\n\\nio\\nns\\n\\n.

The presence of a thematic \\nconstruct of “positive food behaviors” was sup-\\nported by a large eigenvalue and the accompanying \\nscree plot. The 5 items were summed to create an \\nordinal scale (compare prices before buying food, \\nshop with a grocery list, plan meals ahead of time, \\nthink about healthy food choices, and use the food \\nlabel). Reliability analysis indicated an acceptable \\nCronbach’s alpha of 0.74 for the scale which was \\nnormally distributed.38 We compared the “positive \\nfood behavior” scale by acculturation/ethnicity cat-\\negories and by education level. \\n\\nRESULTS\\nCharacteristics of the Participants\\n\\nTable 1 shows the demographic and household \\ncharacteristics of the 358 respondents by the accul-\\nturation/ethnicity categories. The survey comple-\\n\\ntion rate was 80% (358/445). Most women were \\nrecruited at EFNEP (N = 164), and WIC (N = 161), \\nwith a smaller portion from the county unemploy-\\nment center (N = 33). Eighty-two percent of the \\nparticipants self-identified as Hispanic. Whereas \\n39% of the women overall were US-born, 97% of \\nthe Hispanic-dominant and 63% of the bicultural \\nwomen were foreign-born. Seventy-four percent of \\nall women stated they were of Mexican ancestry, and \\n8% indicated other Latin origins (Central America, \\nCaribbean, and South America). Nearly half (45%) \\nof the women were classified as Hispanic-dominant \\n(less acculturated), 25% as bicultural, and 12% as \\nEnglish-dominant (more acculturated) by the BAS, \\nwith 18% as non-Hispanic white.19\\n\\nThere were statistically significant differences by \\nacculturation groups for mean age and educational \\nattainment.

Monthly food \\nexpenditures were not different by acculturation \\nstatus, but the non-Hispanic white women had \\nsignificantly higher monthly incomes than the La-\\ntinas (p < .001).\\n\\nFood Behavior Checklist Questionnaire (FBC) \\nTable 2 shows the frequency distribution and \\n\\nmean scale results of the 10 FBC32 questions on \\nfood resource management, food safety, and nutri-\\ntion practices by acculturation/ethnicity categories. \\nMost women reported positive behaviors for com-\\nparing food prices before purchase (64.5%), plan-\\nning meals (56.3%), and thinking about healthy \\nfood choices for their families (62.9%), and feeding \\ntheir children within 2 hours after waking (66.2%) \\n“most of the time” or “always each day.” Almost \\n51% did not add or seldom added salt to foods \\nduring preparation. Fifty-seven percent reported \\nthey did not let meat or dairy products sit out for \\nmore than 2 hours. \\n\\nFor less healthful practices, 33% reported leav-\\ning frozen foods at room temperature to thaw, and \\n21% stated they ran out of food before the end of \\nthe month “most of the time” or “always.” Twenty-\\nfive percent did not shop with a grocery list, and \\n40% do not use the nutrition facts label in choos-\\ning foods. \\n\\nWe found no statistically significant differences \\nby acculturation/ethnicity categories for 6 of the \\nfood behaviors: compare prices, shop with a gro-\\ncery list, thaw at room temperature, plan meals, \\nthink about healthy food choices, or use the nu-\\ntrition facts label. The remaining 4 questions (run \\nout of food, unrefrigerated meat/dairy, add salt to \\n\\nfood, children eat within 2 hours of waking) were \\nsignificantly different (p < .001 for all). A larger \\npercentage of the Hispanic-dominant women “did \\nnot” or “seldom” ran out of food before the end of \\nthe month, in contrast to their bicultural, English-\\ndominant, or non-Hispanic peers. The more ac-\\nculturated Latinas had the highest food insecurity. \\nHispanic-dominant and bicultural women were \\nmore likely to leave meat or dairy products unre-\\nfrigerated for more than 2 hours, and to add salt to \\nfood during preparation. Women who were His-\\npanic-dominant and bicultural were significantly \\nless likely to feed their children within 2 hours of \\ntheir waking than the English-dominant Latinas \\nand non-Hispanic white women. \\n\\nFive of the 10 food behaviors were significantly \\ndifferent by education level categories with more \\npositive behaviors associated with higher levels of \\neducation: adding salt to food (p < .001), shopping \\nwith a grocery list (p < .001), use of nutrition facts \\nlabel (p = .004), thinking about healthy choices (p \\n= .019), and leaving meat and dairy unrefrigerated \\n(p = .021). \\n\\nThe 5-item summary scale reflecting “positive \\nfood behaviors” from the FBC was normally dis-\\ntributed with a mean of 17.3 ± 4.1. Mean differ-\\nences by acculturation/ethnicity category were not \\nstatistically significant. The “positive food behav-\\niors” score was significantly different by education \\ncategories. Mean values were 17.1 ± 4.6 for 6th grade \\nor less, 16.2 ± 3.7 for 7th-9th grade, 15.6 ± 3.9 for \\n10th-11th grade, 17.5 ± 4.0 for high school graduate, \\n18.5 ± 3.9 for some college, and 19.4 ± 2.8 for as-\\nsociate degree or higher (p < .001). A general linear \\nmodel regressing the “positive food behavior” scale \\non education, acculturation/ethnicity category, and \\nage in years was statistically significant (p = .004). \\nThe value of the adjusted R2 was .06 indicating that \\n94% of the variance was unexplained.38 Although \\na portion of our sample was drawn from current \\nEFNEP classes (45%), there were no statistically \\nsignificant differences on FBC statements by venue \\n(EFNEP, WIC, unemployment center).\\n\\nHealth Characteristics and Risk Factors\\nTable 3 shows self-reported health characteris-\\n\\ntics and health risk factors by acculturation/eth-\\nnicity categories.

Study find-\\nings suggest that both desirable and less desirable \\nhealth behaviors are associated with acculturation \\nstatus in terms of the 10-item FBC, health risk fac-\\ntors, and utilization of health services.\\n\\nLess acculturated Latinas were more likely to be \\nfood secure even though they had a larger house-\\nhold size, more children, and a lower household \\nincome than the bicultural, English-dominant, or \\nnon-Hispanic white women. Despite these positive \\nbehaviors, the Hispanic-dominant women were \\nmore likely to leave meat and dairy foods unrefrig-\\nerated for more than 2 hours compared to their \\nmore acculturated peers. It is possible that this \\npractice relates to irregular mealtimes with larger \\nHispanic families. Our results are similar to those \\nfrom an EFNEP survey on food safety in Arizona \\nconducted in 2000.39 In that study, 54% of the \\nparticipants agreed that leftovers should be allowed \\nto cool before refrigeration.39 Neither ethnic affilia-\\ntion nor acculturation were reported for these data. \\nIn a national survey targeting Mexican-Americans, \\nParra et al17 observed that 19% left food out for \\nmore than 2 hours. Regarding thawing meat, only \\n36% reported using safe practices. Although not \\ndirectly comparable, these findings are similar to \\nthose of the current study and suggest that meet-\\ning proper food handling recommendations is dif-\\nficult, or perhaps an unfamiliar concept among \\nlow-income groups, some of whom are Hispanic. \\nFuture research studies should utilize qualitative \\nmethods to determine possible causality of subop-\\ntimal food safety.\\n\\nApproximately 4% of Arizona participants did \\nnot plan meals, 3% did not think about healthy \\nchoices, 13% did not use a grocery list, and 19% \\ndid not use the nutrition facts label. These respons-\\nes parallel the pre-program FBC responses of 1100 \\nNebraska EFNEP participants.25 The reported per-\\ncentages for Nebraska respondents were: 8.5% did \\nnot plan meals, 4% did not think about healthy \\nfood choices, 29% did not use a grocery list, and \\n25% did not use the nutrition facts label.25 The Ne-\\nbraska survey responses were not reported by race \\nor ethnicity, but based on current state demograph-\\nics, it is presumed that the majority of respondents \\nwere non-Hispanic Whites.25 The use of a grocery \\n\\nlist can reduce impulse buying, assist with meal \\nplanning, and keep shoppers on track with house-\\nhold budgets.40,41 The Nebraska EFNEP program \\nresults also support that there is room for improve-\\nment in food resource management and nutrition \\npractices as measured by the FBC beyond Arizona.\\n\\nPublished reports of FBC responses by accul-\\nturation for Hispanics or ethnicity for most of the \\nindividual 10-item FBC questions for comparison \\nwith our findings were not found.8,39 Some earlier \\nstudies may not have utilized the same wording of \\nthe FBC questions, have had small sample sizes, or \\nused composite scales from the FBC to evaluate pre- \\nand post-program performance.42-45 These method-\\nological differences make direct comparisons to our \\nfindings challenging. However, these other studies \\ndo support the efficacy of the EFNEP curriculum \\nas measured by changes in the FBC over time.42-45 \\nThus, our data can start to fill the research void of \\nFBC responses from women of different ethnici-\\nties, acculturation levels, and geographic areas.\\n\\nSome of the self-reported health risk factors \\n(body weight, smoking, exercise, insured status) of \\nparticipants varied by acculturation status. Hispan-\\nic-dominant women were significantly shorter in \\nstature and weighed less than their bicultural, Eng-\\nlish-dominant, or non-Hispanic white peers. Other \\nstudies have shown increased obesity as women be-\\ncome more acculturated46 and correlations between \\nlonger residence in the US and a higher BMI.47 \\nOur study does not fully support this conclusion, \\npossibly because the English-dominant Latinas \\nwere younger with a high percentage of normal \\nBMIs. It is important to note that because 33% \\nof Hispanic-dominant, 24% of bicultural, 9.5% \\nof English-dominant, and 7.8% of non-Hispanic \\nwhite women did not report their weight and/or \\nheight, these observed trends for body size may be \\naffected by missing data. In addition, self-reported \\nheight and weight can be unreliable. Roberts et al48 \\nfound that women under-reported their weight by \\nan average of 1.1 kg and over-reported height by \\n0.7 cm.\\n\\nWhereas these potential biases may have influ-\\nenced BMIs, the observed obesity levels are much \\nhigher in the study population than in the 2014 \\nBRFSS Arizona statewide data.49 Approximately \\n26% of non-Hispanic Whites and 33% of Hispan-\\nics across Arizona had a BMI greater than 30, or \\n\\n\\n\\nC\\nop\\n\\nyr\\nig\\n\\nht\\n (\\n\\nc)\\n P\\n\\nN\\nG\\n\\n P\\nub\\n\\nlic\\nat\\n\\nio\\nns\\n\\n.

According to 2014 Arizona BRFSS data, \\napproximately 18% of non-Hispanic Whites and \\n23% of Hispanic individuals engaged in no leisure-\\ntime physical activity.50 Lack of physical activity is \\na risk factor for many chronic diseases. Although \\nfewer study participants were inactive compared \\nto the statewide data, 11%-20% is a substantial \\nsegment at risk. Low socioeconomic women may \\nneed encouragement and education on novel ways \\nto obtain adequate physical activity for their opti-\\nmal health. \\n\\nStatistically significant differences in health risk \\nfactors by acculturation emerged for cigarette \\nsmoking, medical insurance coverage, use of physi-\\ncian services for illness, and routine healthcare vis-\\nits. In the US, prevalence of cigarette smoking is \\nstill as high as 40% among persons with low educa-\\ntion and low socioeconomic status.51 In a national \\nsurvey about 19% of Mexican-origin Hispanics re-\\nported smoking in contrast to 21% of Hispanics \\noverall.52 Hispanic women are more likely to try \\nsmoking with greater acculturation, but in general, \\nthe behavior is less socially acceptable than in other \\nethnic groups.52 Among our study participants, \\n4.3%-6.7% of the Hispanic-dominant and bicul-\\ntural women reported current smoking. In com-\\nparison to these rates, 16.5% of the population \\ncurrently smoked cigarettes in the 2014 Arizona \\nBRFSS data.53 Smoking cessation programs would \\nbenefit low-income English-dominant Latinas \\nand non-Hispanic white women, as their smoking \\nprevalence was ~25% for study participants.\\n\\nRegular doctor visits for preventive care are im-\\nportant for health maintenance over the life span. \\nIn 2014, 72.1% of Arizona’s population reported \\na usual source of healthcare with at least one pro-\\nvider on the BRFSS.53 Fifty-seven percent of the \\nEnglish-dominant Latinas and about 61% of the \\nbicultural women received routine medical check-\\nups in the past year, but ~72% of non-Hispanic \\nwhite women had checkups. Only 41% of the \\n\\nHispanic-dominant women had seen a doctor with \\nthat frequency, and they also reported much lower \\nlevels of insurance coverage (22%). These data were \\ncollected shortly after implementation of the Af-\\nfordable Care Act, and during enactment of the \\ncontroversial Arizona Senate Bill 1070 anti-im-\\nmigration legislation.28,29 The Affordable Care Act \\nmay have empowered some participants. For oth-\\ners, the uncertain climate and threat of deportation \\nwith the enactment of Senate Bill 1070 left them \\nvulnerable.29,54 Nationally, the Hispanic popula-\\ntion in 2011 was estimated to have a larger per-\\ncentage of uninsured individuals, 30.1% compared \\nto 14.9% among non-Hispanic Whites.55 Arizona \\nBRFSS respondents in 2014 were more likely to \\nhave no health insurance (14.4%) compared to the \\nnational sample (12.4%).52,55 \\n\\nA major strength of our study was the ability to \\nengage limited-income, foreign-born Hispanics \\nwho are typically wary of researchers – especially \\ndue to the sociopolitical climate in Arizona during \\ndata collection in 2011. Other strengths are adding \\nto the published findings of responses by Hispanic \\nand non-Hispanic white women to the FBC out-\\nside of pre- and post-test EFNEP program evalua-\\ntions. Our results underscore the need for nutrition \\nand health education, the importance of assessing \\nsubpopulations within geographic areas for current \\nbehaviors, and tailoring nutrition education to spe-\\ncific population subgroups, eg acculturation levels.\\n\\nSome study limitations include the use of a cross-\\nsectional convenience sample, a focus on urban \\nwomen, and exclusion of other race/ethnic groups. \\nThus, these results cannot be generalized to other \\nlow-income women in the US. Prospective, longi-\\ntudinal studies to examine the acculturation pro-\\ncess over time and accompanying health behavior \\nchanges are needed. Self-reported anthropometric \\ndata are known to be unreliable.44 Considering that \\nsuch a large share (33%) of Hispanic-dominant \\nwomen did not know their weight and/or height, \\nthe offer to measure these parameters in a private \\nsetting at the time of data collection may have been \\nuseful. Palmer et al56 found similar lack of body size \\nknowledge among low-income Latinas in Iowa.\\n\\nConclusion \\nThese findings show that knowledge of several \\n\\ndesirable food behaviors was lacking in this sample \\n\\nhttp://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.5993/AJHB.42.3.6\\nhttp://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.5993/AJHB.42.3.6\\n\\n\\nC\\nop\\n\\nyr\\nig\\n\\nht\\n (\\n\\nc)\\n P\\n\\nN\\nG\\n\\n P\\nub\\n\\nlic\\nat\\n\\nio\\nns\\n\\n.

We collected these data \\nduring an important time in Arizona as undocu-\\nmented immigrant regulations were tightened. Re-\\nsearch findings indicate food behaviors and some \\nhealth risk factors varied by acculturation status \\nfor women who identified as Hispanic. Accultura-\\ntion status assessment would help tailor nutrition \\nand social programs serving Latinos to their needs. \\nEFNEP, WIC, and other nutrition assistance pro-\\ngrams could help increase awareness of health in-\\nsurance options, food safety practices, and food \\nresource management that would benefit their cli-\\nents, especially less acculturated women. Although \\nLatinas are less likely to need anti-smoking mes-\\nsaging, messaging should be continued to reduce \\nadoption of smoking behaviors as they become \\nmore acculturated. Programs encouraging eligible, \\nyet less acculturated individuals to apply for medi-\\ncal assistance programs could be helpful in increas-\\ning coverage, and thus, lead to more frequent visits \\nfor preventive care or treatment. EFNEP and WIC \\nnutrition education could better meet the needs of \\nparticipants based on the assessed behaviors and \\nknowledge gaps revealed in this study.\\n\\nHuman Subjects Statement\\nThe Arizona State University Institution-\\n\\nal Review Board approved this study (IRB#: \\n100900546216-239).\\n\\nConflict of Interest Statement\\nDMW received a research incentive grant from \\n\\nthe US Dry Bean Council to cover partial costs of \\nthe study.
