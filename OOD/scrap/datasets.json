Since 1996, individual companies can be traced over time, which made it possible to prepare a micro-level panel dataset for research purposes.

Each row contains a latitude/longitude coordinate based on the parolee\u2019s address on file (redacted from this file), as well as additional information on original and derived county, city, and zip code and metadata that indicates who confident we are that the point corresponds to the address. Because the parole system doesn\u2019t include historical data, parolees who exited the system before 2009 won\u2019t be represented in this data set.\n\n\nFrom IDOC:\nplease note you are receiving parolee address information as of the last day of the FY for all active parolees for the added period in question. There are some cautions associated with address data including; some parolees are showing as AWOL which means the parolee is currently not residing at a known/approved location. In addition, some addresses are actually county jail addresses where parolees are being held pending new criminal charges. Some addresses are treatment facilities, recovery homes, or homeless shelters where offenders may be residing temporarily. Finally, some address are merely places where the parolee meets with the agent but does not actually reside. While it is our policy to verify addresses to the best of our ability, there are a number of offenders who do not wish us to know where they really reside and as such, utilize the address of a family member or friend who they know will provide assurance that the parolee resides there. Also please note, addresses are input by Agents so there are always possibilities that human errors are contained in the dataset. These are a few of the reasons why we do not create policy based on address, as a number of our parolees live a transient lifestyle and do not necessarily reside where they work or commit new crimes.\n\n\nPlease access the full dataset in course database table: ildoc.il_doc_parole\n",

This data is derived from the Missouri state Unemployment Insurance (UI) wage file that is supplied to the United States Census Bureau for use in producing Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI).\n\n\nThe mo_wage_percentile table provides the quarterly percentile values of the number of jobs, average earnings, and total earnings for employees' covered sector jobs across the state of MO by year and quarte. These data are derived from the kcmo_lehd.mo_wage table for the years 2006- 2016. The code used to create this table is provided in the create-mo-wage-percentiles.ipynb notebook. Data usage example: for all the people employed in a covered sector in MO in 2008q2, the median value of the number of jobs would be found in column \"job_qtile\" where the row is year=2008, q=2, and pctile=50\n\n\nThe summary of this dataset\u2019s fields is a sample of records only.
